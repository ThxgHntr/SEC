  PROJECT1_DETAILS:
    "Pa Cang Village of Co-Tu residents now receive electricity and water.  Many of the families have by habit grown crops and raised livestock for decades.  Each household has a garden area of over 500m2, yet remain almost empty; not many plants nor do they currently have livestock. The current technology and skills for both gardening and the raising of stock are unknown to these groups living here.\nThis project aims to instruct practical knowledge along with the skills for them to raise livestock and build their own family gardens.  As a result, we would look forward to effectively increase the living standards and social improvements of the community.  We would believe this will contribute to the increase to a cleaner environment as well as to their health and safety of this village.",

Gaining the knowledge and technology to apply the means for organic fertilizer from waste products will supply the manure to the village gardens and farms.

As a result, people would not only understand the process of such from waste, but also have quality fertilizer for their gardens at low cost. The people could also learn the process of running a business in the village. In addition, it contributes to making the environment in the village green and clean.",
