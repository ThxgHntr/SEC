# SEC - Charity Website

![SEC Logo](https://link_to_your_logo.png)

SEC is a charity website aimed at supporting and facilitating charitable projects. We provide a platform for charitable organizations and individuals to create projects, providing detailed descriptions of the objectives and operations of the projects.

## Key Features

- **Charitable Projects**: Allows organizations and individuals to create charitable projects, detailing the goals and operations of the project.
- **Support Projects**: Enables users to support charitable projects by providing financial contributions or volunteering.
- **Account Management**: Provides users with the ability to manage personal information, track contribution history, and interact with projects they have supported.

## Getting Started

1. **Installation**: Clone the repository to your computer:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ThxgHntr/SEC.git
    ```
2. **Configuration**: Modify configuration options in the `config.js` file if necessary.
Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
